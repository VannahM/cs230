Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
-The client was The Gaming Room. The client  wanted a management system to handle everything needed for their game “Draw it or Lose it. They required user-friendly software for both staff and customers to enhance their overall experience. They also requested help expanding their game to other platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
-I was able to clearly outline the software requirements and functionalities in a structured format which aided in aligning development with client expectations. Clarifying objectives helped assure effective communication and understanding of project goals.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
-Knowing what should be included and how everything should function allowed me to thoroughly consider software architecture and user interface design, helping me identify potential challenges early in the development process. This information contributed to a smoother coding experience.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-If I was to revise the document I would choose to revise the evaluation of operating platforms. I might change it to focus on very specific things and compare them equally across each platforms so that the comparisons could be read and weighed easier.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-I focused on taking the clients wants and requirements and directly incorporating them into the design process. By considering their needs and including them in the design process I ensured that the software effectively addressed their expectations and improved user experience.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
-In my design strategy I prioritized considering user wants and needs throughout the entire development process. Keeping these requirements in mind allowed me to create a user concentrated design that enhances functionality and overall satisfaction.
